## Usage

To use a snippet, open a supported programming (.py or .go) file and start typing the prefix of the snippet you want to use. The snippet should appear in the IntelliSense suggestions. You can then insert it by clicking on it or pressing the Tab or Enter key.

## Snippets

These snippets follow a convention to make it easier to use. As you are typing, the intellisense dropdown will show you related snippets.

### Convention

- All snippets start with `_v`.
- Adding a template start with `_vt` then the name of the template. Ex: `_vtmain`.
- Adding a component start with `_vc` then the name of the component. Ex: `_vcsensor`.
- Importing components have the same command as adding a component, but with _import at the end. Ex: `_vcsensor_import`.

### Templates

| Command | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `_vtconnect` | Establish a connection to a robot with an address or channel. |
| `_vtmain` | Template that establishes a connection to a robot with a main async event loop. |

### Components

| Command | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `_vcarm` | Initializes an Arm object. |
| `_vcbase` | Initializes a Base object. |
| `_vcboard` | Initializes a Board object. |
| `_vccamera` | Initializes a Camera object. |
| `_vccontroller` | Initializes a Controller object and handles its controls and events. |
| `_vcencoder` | Initializes an Encoder object. |
| `_vcgantry` | Initializes a Gantry object. |
| `_vcgripper` | Initializes a Gripper object. |
| `_vcmotor` | Initializes a Motor object. |
| `_vcmovementsensor` | Initializes a Movement Sensor object. |
| `_vcsensor` | Initializes a Sensor object. |
| `_vcservo` | Initializes a Servo object. |
