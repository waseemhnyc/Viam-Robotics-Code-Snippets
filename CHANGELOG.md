# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Viam Code Snippets" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-02-05

### Why is this a major release? 

I'm creating some videos using these current snippets to build a few projects. While building, I'll probably push some minor updates. 
The goal is that the next major release will have more snippet templates that you can just import, change a few variables and run.

### Added

- Typescript Snippets 



## [0.7.0] - 2024-01-12

### Added

- Golang Snippets 
- Generic and Power Sensor Components
